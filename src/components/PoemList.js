      "Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,",
      "Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown",
      "And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command",
      "Tell that its sculptor well those passions read",
      "Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,",
      "The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.",
      "And on the pedestal these words appear:",
      "'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:",
      "Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'",
      "Nothing beside remains. Round the decay",
      "Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,",
        "The lone and level sands stretch far away\"."

      "The wild blast, rising from the Western cave,",
      "Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed;",
      "Tears from their grassy tombs the village dead,",
      "And breaks the silent sabbath of the grave!",
      "With shells and sea-weed mingled, on the shore",
      "Lo! their bones whiten in the frequent wave;",
      "But vain to them the winds and waters rave;",
      "They hear the warring elements no more:",
      "While I am doom'dâ€”by life's long storm opprest,",
      "To gaze with envy on their gloomy rest."
